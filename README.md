# Unity Custom Editor Generator
  
Read the post/tutorial about this utility [on my blog](https://owenmagelssen.com/posts/unity-custom-editor-generation/)  

This Unity editor utility will generate a custom editor script for a MonoBehaviour or ScriptableObject in your project by right-clicking on 
it and selecting Create > Custom Editor. All serialized fields from the script are populated as SerializedProperty members in the editor script. 
This project is intended to be a starting point for a solution that suits the needs of your project. See some of my suggestions for extending it 
[in the post](https://owenmagelssen.com/posts/unity-custom-editor-generation/#next-steps).
